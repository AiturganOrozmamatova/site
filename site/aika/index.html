            <h3>Hello! Our project is called 21 days. We give you change your life for the better within 21 days. The goal of our project is to help you acquire positive habits. But why 21 days?</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Each of the participants will have a mentor. A mentor will help you with advice. A meeting with the mentor should occur every 3 days and you will be required to give an account of what has been done to each participant. For example, how many books have you read? Or how many miles did you run?</h3>
            <span class="text-pro">Theory of 21 days</span>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>
                As British scientists tell us, if you repeat a certain action systematically within twenty one days, it will become a habit and vice versa, you need 21 days to get rid of the habit. You want to quit smoking, endure 21 days without cigarettes, you want to start smoking, so try for 21 days.

                Charging is an obvious blessing, but it's not easy for me. Frankly, hard given through force. Therefore, I chose a simple complex for ass ABL + a couple of exercises for the press + medical gymnastics for the back, which the doctor ordered. A total of an hour. And she did it for 21 days in any weather, in any mood and with any well-being. It should be noted that well-being has improved, yes. Visually there are no special changes. To the touch, they say, "oh, yes, cool, do not stop there are positive changes. Was it easy? No! Every day I forced myself, delayed the moment of beginning, suffered, but then I gathered my ass in a handful of fists and did it. in the morning, when I got up, then morning, I did it in the evening — I almost died, it was much harder.

                Has it become a habit? I can not say. But I don’t want to rush straight to the press bench. For myself, I decided that I can not do today. And most likely with joy I will not. Then I add approaches, loads and I will again, because after the workout I feel better.

                From the very positive: therapeutic exercises for the back have become painless. The first time I did them with tears, although nothing like that, all sorts of stretching, holding, lying on the rollers. During this 21 days I have never had a backache, although I don’t even remember when it was such a miracle.
                Bottom line: the habits did not appear, the desire to do exercises, too, no, but based on my well-being, I will continue.

    <div class = "text-mentor">
        <p>A mentor is a coach, guide, tutor, facilitator, councelor and trusted advisor. A mentor is someone willing to spend his or her time and expertise to guide the development of another person.

        <h3> How to find a good mentor?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class = "text-mentor">
        <p>
            Most people misunderstand mentoring — I certainly did. For the longest time, I said I wanted a mentor but didn’t understand what that even meant. That is, until someone pulled me aside, invested in me, and taught me what a mentor really was.
            I see a lot of young people approaching mentoring the wrong way.
            They ask a leader they admire to mentor them, forcing the person into an awkward position in which she feels bad for saying “no” or obligated to say “yes.” But this is not how mentoring works.
            I have a passion to see that change. There is a lot of misunderstanding about how mentoring works, including how to begin a relationship with a mentor. Here are some of them:

            Mentoring is about me.
            I need to wait for a mentor to find me.
            Being mentored is more passive than active.
            I need to ask someone to mentor me up-front.
            Face it: Everything you know about mentoring may be wrong. It’s time to start seeking out a mentor the right way. In finding a mentor, there are 10 important steps I’ve found that usually work:

        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class = "text-mentor">
        <p>
            Don’t just find someone who has a job you want or a platform that you covet.

            Find someone that is like you, someone with a similar set of strengths and skills you want to emulate. Otherwise, you’ll just end up frustrated.

            Spend some time finding the right person. In fact, have several candidates before committing to a single mentor.

            Follow his blog. Get to know people who know him.

            If you don’t know the person well, see if he is really like his public persona projects.

            Make sure you understand his strengths and weaknesses. Set your expectations realistically.

    </div>
    <div class = "text-mentor">
        <p>
            Don’t ask for the person to “be your mentor” right off the bat. That’s a big ask. Far too big for the first meeting.

            Rather, ask for an initial meeting — something informal, over coffee maybe. Keep it less than an hour.

            Come with questions that you’re prepared to ask, but let the conversation flow relationally. (Note: the formality really depends on the potential mentor’s communication style — something you should be aware of before the initial meeting.)

            When in doubt about when to make the ask, just go for it. (That’s what I do, and it usually works.)

        <p>
            After meeting, do you want to spend more time with this person?

            Did she begin the meeting by encouraging you or telling you what to do? Did she ask questions, or wait to provide answers?

            Did you leave the meeting feeling better about yourself? Was a connection made? If not, feel free to let the relationship go and seek out someone else, instead. You don’t have time to waste on a self-centered tyrant.

            If it went well, then immediately put together a follow-up plan.</p>

            This is not like dating. It’s okay to appear overly ambitious. You want this person to know that you’re serious.

            It’s appropriate to follow up immediately, thanking your prospective mentor for her time.

            A good way to do this is via email or other form of passive communication, so that you don’t appear overbearing or waste the person’s time.

            This is also a good time to mention that you’d like to do it again. If she reciprocates, offer to get something on the calendar. (You may need to suggest a time.)

            Make sure that it feels relaxed and not contrived. You’re still vetting each other at this point.</p>
