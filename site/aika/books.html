Smarter, Faster, Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg</a></h3>
        </div>
        <img src="images/2.jpg"><p>
        This book offers eight productivity concepts that help explain why some people and companies are able to accomplish so much more than others. Drawing from information on neuroscience and behavioral psychology, along with the experiences of successful CEOs, generals, pilots, FBI agents, and Broadway songwriters, this well-researched book reveals how productive people and companies view the world in profoundly different ways than those who find less success.

        For example, a group of Google's data scientists conducts a four-year study on how the most effective teams function and find that a group's interactions are more important than the members of the group. Additionally, the experts who created the movie Frozen almost gave up after encountering some challenges before they decided to shake up their team in a way that initiated a creative breakthrough, leading to one of the highest-grossing movies to date.

        This book explains that what these success stories have in common is that the people know that their productivity relies on making specific choices. The things that separate busy people from productive people are the ways decisions are made, the ambitions that are embraced, and the seemingly easy goals that are ignored. Leaders are able to establish cultures to prompt innovation and interact with data to create success.

        This inspirational book uses rich storytelling to explain how people can improve their everyday lives. This innovative exploration of productivity can help anyone learn how to succeed without having to endure stress, struggle, or sacrifice.

        In this book, the author explores eight ideas that are the most important to improving one's productivity, including motivation, teams, focus, goal setting, managing other people, effective decision making, innovation, and absorbing data. Readers have stated that this book is written in a lively and eloquent way. With narratives from some of the best journalists and leaders, the author is able to anchor the reader in many real-world situations to help drive home some key points. Many valuable lessons are shared with the reader along with dos and don’ts of living a productive life and being successful in business, especially when stressful situations arise.

Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela Duckworth</a></h3>
        </div><img src="images/3.jpg">
            <p>
                The author of this book, psychologist Angela Duckworth, shows her readers that the secret to success is something she refers to as "grit." She addresses all types of people from parents to students to business people to highlight the importance of the blend of passion and persistence. Duckworth refers to her own experiences beginning early on in her life that made her come to this conclusion.

                In "Grit", the author tells the real-life stories of cadets who are struggling through their initial experiences at West Point, teachers trying to work with students in inner-city schools, and insights from high achievers such as JP Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon and Seattle Seahawks' Coach, Pete Carroll.
                Some of the most valuable insights that the reader should take away from this book include why one's efforts are so important regarding a long-term goal, how passion and perseverance can be learned, and how one can trigger a lifelong interest for their craft.

                Readers have found this book to be personal and insightful because it addresses what goes through one's head during a failure, and how those thoughts can make a big difference in one's future. Readers say that this is a great book to read for one's own success, especially if you can accept the idea that success is all about hard work.

        <p>
            I have been a fan of James’ books and his excellent podcast since he invited my as a guest many years ago when I first started writing books online. James is a serial entrepreneur, having started as many as 20 different companies.

            He also happens to be brilliant and really nice guy. Rare combinations: smart, entrepreneurial, kind, and with a gift for gab; knowing how to put some complex thinking into digestible bits the rest of us can easily understand.

            I love many of his books, but Choose Yourself remains my favorite, and I think is one of the single best motivational books around. Because that is the entire point of the book. When it comes to “what” you should invest in to achieve success, his point is to “choose yourself”.

            Showcasing real life interviews and case studies, James shows us how the current world market is ripe for entrepreneurial self starters to succeed if they invest their energy in themselves.

            A wonderful book sure to motivate you to make the most of your own talents.

            Choose Yourself! Choose this book!

High-Hanging Fruit: Build Something Great by Going Where No One Else Will by Mark Rampolla</a></h3>
        </div><img src="images/5.jpg">
        <p>
            This book, written by ZICO Coconut Water founder Mark Rampolla, aims to teach the reader that when you reach higher, you will be able to build a successful business, make a great profit, and possibly even leave a lasting mark on the world.

            Drawing from his own experience of not being inspired enough in his job and dreaming about more, Rampolla talks about his journey to selling coconut water in the United States. His ambitious goal created a whole new industry that brought America a healthy beverage alternative while also helping producers of the product in developing worlds profit from this resource.

            This book was written for other people who want to succeed in light of their values. It may be the right book for you if you believe that it is your job to strive to build businesses that are driven by passion and purpose, along with a strong sense of integrity. This is a great book for a new generation of entrepreneurs to read who want to change the old model of business and exceed in innovative ways.

            The lessons in this book can benefit anyone. Not only is the book well written, but it is also a page-turner when talking about the battle that the author had to fight with the American beverage business and his courage to stand up for his beliefs. Readers respect that the author believes that if people remain true to their core values, they have the ability to be successful and even promote social change.

Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton</a></h3>
        </div><img src="images/6.jpg">
        <p>
            This is a follow-up book to Clifton's First, Break All the Rules. The author uses his theories from his first book to help the reader discover what their specific strengths and talents are in life.

            This book aims to debunk what the author believes to be a myth that many of us were told as children, which is that anyone can be anything they want to be. Some readers may find this opinion to be unsettling when beginning this book, however, the author presents the idea in a very freeing way. He argues that instead of following callings that are likely to be dead ends, it is better to pursue the things that you are naturally wired to do. This will result in a happier and more successful life.

            This idea can even apply to parenting. If your child comes home with several A's and B's, but also has an F, do you spend your energy focusing on the bad grade or praising your child for the good grades? Rather than trying to fix weaknesses that your child has no desire in, the author argues that it is better to encourage them in the subjects that they are strong. Focus on the things that your children show interest in and have a talent for and allow those strengths to grow.

            This is a great book to change one's way of thinking. Regardless of one's personality, readers have found that this book and test can dramatically change the way you view the world and approach life. One slight weakness in this book is that it does not go deeper into his theory rather he just scratches the surface, however, the author does a very effective job showing how he developed this process through years of study.

        <p>
            This book was written in 1937 and has become a classic. The text and formatting of the original book have been preserved as best as possible to be kept exactly the same as it was in the original release. This book was originally published during the Great Depression and it is about the art of convincing yourself to become wealthy. It addresses the important steps to take and the equally important steps to avoid in this process.

            While some people have not found this book to be very useful, others refute that opinion by saying that one has to implement the strategies in the book in order to upgrade their lives.

            There are a lot of captivating points and ideas in this book. For example, the author argues that 99% of people do not have a goal in their life and are therefore trapped in jobs that make them unhappy. Additionally, he proposes the idea that sex transmutation is an effective strategy to achieve success. This is where one transfers the energy of their libido into other purposes that are aimed at acquiring wealth.

            The author also makes a solid point that most people do not achieve full success until later in life or at least after the age of 40. A few examples the author points out are Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie, who were both over the age of 40 when they acquired their fortunes.

            Readers have found the author's roundtable ideas to be very intriguing and applicable to people of any background. If life is a game, these are the rules.

Illuminate: Ignite Change Through Speeches, Stories, Ceremonies, and Symbols by Duarte & Sanchez</a></h3>
        </div><img src="images/8.jpg">
        <p>
            This book focuses on the idea that people who are able to change the world are the ones who truly believe they are able to. For example, Steve Jobs was able to captivate audiences when beginning his movement that led to Apple Inc. This is because he was telling his audience about his vision for the future and inviting them to join him in his ideas.

            Leaders have great potential to anticipate the future with their inventions and inspire others to support their dreams. In this book, the authors provide the reader with the powerful communication tools that are needed for great leadership.

            They are able to lay out a plan to help the reader lead people through all of the stages of transformation through the use of speeches, symbols, stories, and ceremonies.

            This guidebook shows that while envisioning the future may be one thing, getting other people to follow your lead is another. By using persuasive communication, anyone can turn an idea into a movement. Due to the valuable insights and the immediate impact that this book provides, many readers choose to read it multiple times to continue to motivate themselves to work alongside their followers rather than try to embark on their vision alone.

        </div><img src="images/9.jpg">
        <p>
            Jocko Willink experienced the most violent battlefield in Iraq while serving on the SEAL team before writing this book, granting him great authority to write a book on leadership and success. While in Iraq, he helped U.S. forces secure Ramadi, and wrote this firsthand account of victory, heroism, and loss in SEAL Team Three’s Task Unit Bruiser.

            During his experience, he learned that leadership is the most important element of success or failure. Once he returned to the United States, he began a SEAL leadership training program before expanding his leadership training to successful companies and clients.

            In this book, he details the mindset and principles that allow SEAL units to accomplish their combat missions and shows how to apply this methodology to any team or organization. Each chapter of this book concentrates on a distinct topic such as Decentralized Command and Leading Up the Chain. The author explains what each topic is, their relevance, and how to put them to use in a leadership environment.

            This is a compelling read that includes direct instructions and methods of application. It is great for business management and it tasks existing leaders to fulfill their goal of leading and winning. One great thing about this book is that it is structured in a basic and clear way. The book focuses on just one main point in each chapter through a story and then calls attention to the main principle of that story and how it can be applied.

        <p>
            Prior to writing this book, Tim Ferriss spent two years interviewing over 200 top-notch performers, including celebrities, athletes, legendary Special Operations commanders, and black-market biochemists. During these in-depth two to three hour interviews, Ferriss was able to learn the distilled tools, tactics, and tricks to getting ahead that readers are unable to find anywhere else.

            Ferriss offers his advice to readers with his constant focus on actionable details. He asks his interviewees specific questions such as what their morning routine looks like and how they fit physical exercise into their schedules. He also inquires about books that have inspired these experts and even things they consider to be a waste of time.

            Everything that is written in this book has been explored and applied to the author's own life, so he considers them to be tried and true pieces of advice. He prides his work on the fact that it has made him millions of dollars and saved him from years of wasted efforts.

            In this exciting book, Tim does a great job of making the reader feel as if he is talking directly to them. In this well-formatted and easy-to-follow book, the reader is offered advice that is commonly revisited throughout the years. Some have referred to this book as being a "manual to life" because it leads to a lot of reflection and positive changes in the people who read it.
